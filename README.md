# ThermalTake Tower 300 LCD Stuff
Here's some miscellaneous stuff for the ThermalTake Tower 300 PC Case. The lower cover, where a ThermalTake 3.9" can be placed, is replaced by a 7.84" LCD with mini HDMI interface. The HDMI cable can be connected as a secondary/tertiary/any display within Windows. You can run any tools or screen add-on on this display. In this example AIDA64 Extreme is used to display a Sensor Panel. This repository contains the information needed to create your own display.

### The Display
The display used is a 7.84" 1280x400 pixels display from WaveShare. Bought from eBay, seller "BuyDisplay", but they're also available on Amazon and many other webshops. Just make sure its the 7.84" display and not the 8" display, the latter will not fit in the opening of the cover. Be careful with the FPC-cable, it's very fragile and any folding or scratching can cause permanent damage.
